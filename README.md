Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic started with an unexplained incidence of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and spread swiftly. PRC CDC investigated respiratory samples and found a novel coronavirus causing pneumonia (NCP). Before, coronavirus erupted. The world has been plagued with pandemics such as SARS-CoV, Spanish Influenza, and MERS-CoV. COVID-19 affected 209 countries, including Pakistan. (Patel et al., 2021).

It later spread to Europe and had effects on the economy and other areas of life. On the dead, new cases and the economy specifically inflation is what our research will be based on mainly based on as we compare the UK to France. The Uk economy shrunk by a fifth ( Jena et al.,2021; Dodd,2020) 

According to (‘Inflation and price indices - Office for National Statistics, 2021;)The rate of inflation is the change in prices for goods and services over time. Measures of inflation and prices include consumer price inflation, producer price inflation and the House Price Index” or  as (‘Inflation: Prices on the Rise’, 2022) states “Inflation measures how much more expensive a set of goods and services has become over a certain period, usually a year”.
